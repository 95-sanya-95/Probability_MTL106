## Gladiatorial Tournament Management

In this project, we are managing a gladiatorial tournament where warriors face off against each other. There are two teams managed by myself and Alice. Each team consists of warriors with varying strengths.

### Strategies Evaluated:

1. **Best Warrior Strategy:** Always pick the warrior with the highest strength available.
2. **Worst Warrior Strategy:** Always pick the warrior with the lowest strength available.

### Observations:

- By running Monte Carlo Simulations, we observed the probabilities of winning under each strategy.
- We also evaluated the expected gain of strength when facing an opponent with a given strength.
- We explored an optimal strategy based on the total strength of the team after each match.

### Implementation:

We implemented these strategies in Python code. The code includes functions for simulating fights, choosing warriors based on different strategies, evaluating expected gains, and conducting Monte Carlo Simulations for optimal strategy estimation.

### Usage:

- Replace the example warrior strengths with your own last 4 digits.
- Execute the code to observe the results of each strategy and their probabilities of winning.

### Note:

- The simulations are limited to 10^5 iterations for efficiency.
- Each part of the code execution should take less than 5 seconds.
- Detailed calculations and explanations are provided within the code comments.
